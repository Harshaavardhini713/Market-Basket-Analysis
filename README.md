Market Basket Analysis

In this project, we experiment with a real world dataset, and to explore how machine learning algorithms can be used to find the patterns in data.

Income is the consumption and saving opportunity gained by an entity within a specified time frame. Household income is the combined gross income of all members of a household who are 15 years or older. Information about income can be used in many parts crucial parts of our daily life like in how different patterns of income distribution influence household well-being and peopleâ€™s ability to get the goods and services to meet their needs and wants, for tax determination, loan and other banking purposes.

Market Basket Analysis deals with a data set which uses various factors like education level, occupation, marital status and ethnicity to determine the annual income of a person. We use these social facets to find those which among them plays a major role in deciding the annual income of a person and which are irrelevant.

The coding was done in R and the following ML models were used:

1. Linear Discriminant Analysis
2. K Nearest Neighbours
3. Bootstrap
4. Neural Network
5. Support Vector Machine
6. Splines
7. Trees (Decision tree,Random Forest,Pruned Decision Tree, Regression Tree, Bagging)
8. Boosting
